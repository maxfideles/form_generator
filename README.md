# Form Generator

The software was developed to improve the creation of forms in an accomodation for international students based in London. The code was initially taken as an example from the 'Code is fun’ channel’s [video](https://youtu.be/fziZXbeaegc), and adapted to the accommodation needs.

Using this form generator you can create new document files from templates and save them in a different folder automatically, in this case, it will save the new documents into the folder called new.

It's possible to calculate the amount the guest or student should be charged automatically from the dates and the amount of the fee per week. In addition to some forms, for example (payment received and booking confirmation) after entering the data, a pdf document is created and opens MS Outlook with a pre-written message with the newly created pdf document attached to the e-mail automatically.
